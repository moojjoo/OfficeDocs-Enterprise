# Deploy Office 365 Enterprise for your organization
Ready to deploy and integrate Office 365 Enterprise with your on-premises infrastructure? These overview steps are designed to help you connect your directory, migrate your data, and help the people in your organization begin using the latest version of Office 2016.

FastTrack guides you through the most common deployment configurations and can answer questions along the way. If you want to self-help or guidance from a partner, use our [Office 365 setup guide](https://support.office.com/article/Set-up-Office-365-for-business-6a3a29a0-e616-4713-99d1-15eda62d04fa), our [Office 365 setup wizards](https://aka.ms/o365fasttrack), or [find a qualified partner](https://partnercenter.microsoft.com/en-us/pcv/search).

## Self-deployment of Office 365
If you want to deploy Office 365 on your own, the following deployment steps are here to help.

1. **[Get ready for Office 365](get-your-organization-ready-for-office-365.md)**. These tools and resources will help you get your network, directory, and end users ready for Office 365.

2. **[Sign in and add your internet domain(s) to Office 365](https://portal.office.com/Domains/AddDomainWizard.aspx?Scenario=AdvancedSetup)**. Sign into the portal and add one or more domains to your Office 365 subscription without adding users or migrating email. If you want to configure all your users and services at the same time, follow our [basic set up instructions](https://support.office.com/article/Set-up-Office-365-for-business-6a3a29a0-e616-4713-99d1-15eda62d04fa).

>[!IMPORTANT] 
>The basic set up instructions won't work if you want to synchronize your users from an on-premises directory or utilize Single Sign-On.

3. **[Connect your directory to Office 365](https://support.office.com/article/Understanding-Office-365-Identity-and-Azure-Active-Directory-06a189e7-5ec6-4af2-94bf-a22ea225a7a9)**. Guide to the identity synchronization and/or single sign-on configuration options. Use the [AAD Connect advisor](https://aka.ms/aadconnectpwsync) and the [Azure AD Premium setup guide](https://aka.ms/aadpguidance) to get customized set up guidance.
4. **[Configure Office 365 services and applications](configure-services-and-applications.md)**. Start here to configure email, file sharing, instant messaging, or any of the other Office 365 services and applications.
5. **[Migrate data to Office 365](migrate-data-to-office-365.md)**. Once the services are configured, you can start migrating data.
6. **[Get people using Office 365](https://support.office.com/article/Get-started-with-Office-365-for-business-d6466f0d-5d13-464a-adcb-00906ae87029)**. Help people in your organization build confidence using Office 365 with these resources.
