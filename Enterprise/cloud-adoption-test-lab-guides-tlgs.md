# Test Office 365 with cloud adoption Test Lab Guides (TLGs)

 **Summary:** Use these cloud adoption Test Lab Guides (TLGs) to set up demonstration, proof of concept, or dev/test environments for Office 365, Dynamics 365, and Office Server products.
  
TLGs help you quickly learn about Microsoft products. They're great for situations where you need to evaluate a technology or configuration before you decide whether it's right for you or before you roll it out to users. The "I built it out myself and it works" hands-on experience helps you understand the deployment requirements of a new product or solution so you can better plan for hosting it in production.
  
TLGs also create representative environments for development and testing of applications, also known as dev/test environments.

- [DirSync for your Office 365 dev/test environment](dirsync-for-your-office-365-dev-test-environment.md)
    
    Install and configure Azure AD Connect for directory synchronization with password synchronization. This is an optional step if you want to build a simulated enterprise configuration.
    
For your Office 365 dev/test environment, use these articles to demonstrate enterprise features of Office 365:
  
- [Multi-factor authentication for your Office 365 dev/test environment](multi-factor-authentication-for-your-office-365-dev-test-environment.md)
    
    Configure and test secondary authentication using a text message sent to your smart phone for an account in your Office 365 subscription.

    Configure and demonstrate federated authentication with the accounts of a Windows Server Active Directory domain.
    
- [Cloud App Security for your Office 365 dev/test environment](cloud-app-security-for-your-office-365-dev-test-environment.md)
    
    Configure and demonstrate Office 365 Cloud App Security, which lets you create policies that monitor for and inform you of suspicious activities in your Office 365 subscription.
    
- [Advanced Threat Protection for your Office 365 dev/test environment](advanced-threat-protection-for-your-office-365-dev-test-environment.md)
    
    Configure and demonstrate Advanced Threat Protection, which is a feature of Exchange Online Protection (EOP) that helps keep malware out of your email.
    
- [Advanced eDiscovery for your Office 365 dev/test environment](advanced-ediscovery-for-your-office-365-dev-test-environment.md)
    
    Add example data and demonstrate Advanced eDiscovery, which lets you quickly find and analyze the data that is stored in Office 365, including email and documents.
    
- [Sensitive file protection in the Office 365 dev/test environment](sensitive-file-protection-in-the-office-365-dev-test-environment.md)
    
    Demonstrate how you can use Office 365 Information Rights Management to protect the data in sensitive documents, even when they are accidentally posted in the wrong document folders.
    
- [Data classification and labeling in the Office 365 dev/test environment](data-classification-and-labeling-in-the-office-365-dev-test-environment.md)
    
    Demonstrate how the Azure Information Protection (AIP) client can be used to classify documents with various levels of security.
    
- [Isolated SharePoint Online team site dev/test environment](isolated-sharepoint-online-team-site-dev-test-environment.md)
    
    Demonstrate how to create a SharePoint Online team site that is isolated from the rest of the organization for sensitive or highly confidential resources.
    
## The Microsoft 365 Enterprise test environment

Create a test environment for [Microsoft 365 Enterprise](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-enterprise/) with [these articles](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/m365-enterprise-test-lab-guides).
 
    
## Office 365 and Dynamics 365 dev/test environment

Add a Dynamics 365 trial subscription and test Office 365 and Dynamics 365 integrated features and scenarios with these articles:
  
- [Office 365 and Dynamics 365 dev/test environment](office-365-and-dynamics-365-dev-test-environment.md)
    
    Add a Dynamics 365 trial subscription and Dynamics 365 licences and permissions to your user accounts.
